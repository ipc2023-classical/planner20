# FSM planner

FSM is a learning-based planner that uses different sample generation improvement strategies to learn a heuristic function for classical planning. The heuristic function is a neural network trained on pairs of states and cost-to-goal estimates generated by regression from the goal state. The short time for sampling, training, and testing allows FSM to be competitive on the classical track of the IPC. The time dedicated to each of the mentioned steps is 15, 10, and 5 minutes, respectively.

FSM planner is completely based on the paper [Understanding Sample Generation Strategies for Learning Heuristic Functions in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13316) and a fork from [Neural Fast Downward](https://github.com/PatrickFerber/NeuralFastDownward), which in turn derives from [Fast Downward](https://github.com/aibasel/downward).
